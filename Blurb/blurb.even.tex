\section{Summary}
The unifying theme of this section is that tunes
are `even`, as in ${2}\over{4}$ or ${4}\over{4}$.
They might be stylistically unrelated, but for convenience
are put in the same bucket.

\begin{description}[noitemsep]
\item[Hora ca la Caval]
	\dots
	a different bass line is more effective
	\dots
    I don't recall how it goes at the moment
\item[Dorogoj Dlinnoju]
	Russian Roma tune, popularized as
	`Those Were The Days My Friend`
\item[Ederlezi / Đurđevdan]
	The letter `Đ` (lower case `đ`) is uniquely Serbian
	and sounds like the `G` in `George`.  In fact,
	`Đurđevdan` means `(Saint) George's Day`.
	Ederlezi is the Roma name of St.\ George's Day.
\item[Varshaver Freylekhs] `Varshaver` is the adjective
	referring to `Warsaw`
