These are tunes that I'm learning.

Usually the tunes are 'deranged'.
Derangement is the opposite of arrangment, where the following ornaments are removed
 - repeated notes (when they're in the same beat)
 - trills
 - vamping
Ornaments that are left
 - drops

Tunes are usually transposed into a 'd' scale.
The reason for being in 'd' is that the structure of the tunes should be more apparent when there are fewer scales, and some tunes can be directly compared.
