These are tunes that I'm learning.

Whenever possible, links to originals are provided.

I tend to typeset my own version of whatever I'm learning (or thinking about learning) for the following reasons
 - I can 'derange' tunes that others have obscenely arranged
 - I can transpose to a key that I'm focusing on
    - later I can transpose to any another key that I want to work on
 - I get to tweak the tunes
 - other minor points:
    - my music uniform
    - my music is backed up
    - it's easy to typeset


Usually the tunes are 'deranged'.
Derangement is the opposite of arrangment.
The problems with arrangement are that
 - it obscures the underlying melody & rhythm
 - it specializes a tune to a particular instrument, making it weird on an unrelated instrument

My current thinking is that the following ornaments should be removed
 - repeated notes (when they're in the same beat)
 - trills
 - vamping

Ornaments that are left
 - drops

Tunes are usually transposed into a 'd' scale.
The reason for using the same root note is that the structure of the tunes should be more apparent when there are fewer scales,
    and some tunes can be directly compared.
Once a tune is memorized in 'd', then start playing in other scales w/o sheet music.

Common keys in this repo
 - d freygish (or altered phrygian) (7 tunes at last count)
 - d minor (6 tunes)
 - d dorian (2 tunes)
 - d mixolydian (2 tunes)
 - d major (1 tune)
 - d locrian (1 tune)
 - d lydian (1 tune)

A few tunes are not deranged, or are not in 'd'.
These are tunes I don't fully understand yet.
