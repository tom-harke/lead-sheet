There are 2 spelling schemes used for titles of songs, and they
are not consistent.
  - Romanian/Moldovan
  - Slavic languages

Both schemes add extra letters, needed to make spelling (roughly) phonetic.  Both scheme use familiar letters in different ways than English.

Romanian (and Moldovan) are Romance languages, written in the Latin alphabet, with extra letters
    ţ   ts
    ş   sh
    ă   ...
    â   ...
    î   (same as â)

    c   is /ch/ when followed by e or i
    c   is /k/ otherwise
    g   is /dz/ when followed by e or i
    g   is /g/ otherwise

Bulgarian, Macedonian, Serbian, and Croatian are Slavic languages.
The languages are similar, and all but the last are written in Cyrillic.
Croatian uses the Latin alphabet and adds several letters
  
    - č ...
    - ć ...
    - dž    ...
    - đ ...
    - lj    ...
    - nj    ...
    - š ...
We use the Croatian convention for the other Slavic languages, but
with few more additions for sounds in the other languages that don't
occur in Croatian
  - Bulgarian
     - ă    -- same quality as ă in Romanian
  - Macedonian
     - ḱ
     - ǵ
