The logic behind how songs are alphabetized

 - The following are ignored
    - names of rhythms, in particular
       - geampara (and geamparaua, geamparale, geamparalele)
       - pandelaş
       - (h)ostropăţ
       - rəčinica
    - articles & prepositions, in particular
       - romanian
          - ca
          - de
          - din
          - la
          - lui
 - 2-page songs come before 1-page
    - this is so that each half will appear on facing pages
 - Letters with diacritics (such as `č)` are separate from the underlying letter, and appear after.
   (so `c` comes before `č`)
